Contains the code required to replicate results in Actuarial Credibility in a Reinforcement Learning Context by Riis-Due et. al.

The notebooks provide code for RL applications to actuarial credibility including the simple toy model discussed in the paper, the random renewal case, and the healthy/sick model.

There is no guarantee that these models will be right for you if you are an insurer. If you have any questions contact Austin Riis-Due through acriisdu@uwaterloo.ca for more details.
